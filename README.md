Hi ðŸ‘‹, my name is khalled meneouali, Fullstack Developer with a purely IT and versatile training and an enriching experience as a Fullstack Developer without  ðŸ‘€  forgetting the passionate self-taught side, my passion for software consists in imagining ideas and making them come true with stylish interfaces. I take great care of the experience, architecture, and code quality of the things I build.
I've learned a lot from the open source community âœ¨ and love how the collaboration and knowledge sharing has been done through open source.
